// 14-01 (A2) — the value and the chart must arrive together.
//
// The operator's A2 is "Zahlenwerte kommen deutlich später als ihre Grafik".
// On a series-backed metric detail the store publishes the series first
// (`ChartDetailStore+Loading.swift`, the `seriesAsync` await) and only after two
// further best-effort roundtrips — findings, then the metric summary — awaits
// the measurements page that settles `latestRawMeasurement`, `recentInRange`
// and `dataState`. The chart short-circuits on `series` alone, so it paints at
// once; every dataState-gated number block above it (Min/Ø/Max/Median, the
// headline's raw-latest refinement) waits for two requests it does not depend
// on, and then pushes the chart down when it lands.
//
// The two roundtrips are already concurrent with the page — nothing here asks
// for more requests, and nothing here may add one. What the fix moves is the
// ORDER of the awaits, so the value furniture settles with the chart.
//
// Drives the REAL store over the REAL `APIClient` on a session-scoped
// `MockURLProtocolSession` (09-13 discipline, opaque `<token>.mock.invalid`
// addressing), because the defect lives in the ordering of the fan-out's
// awaits and not in any single one of them.
