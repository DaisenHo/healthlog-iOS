/// **Audit v0.14.8 N5.3 — anchored-sweep interleave guard.**
///
/// The HK importers (`WorkoutHealthKitImporter`, `CycleHealthKitImporter`) run
/// `runAnchoredSweep()` from every observer fire. The sweep is actor-isolated,
/// but it suspends across `await fetch(...)` / `await drain(...)` — and actors
/// are reentrant at suspension points, so two rapid observer fires interleave
/// two sweeps **from the same persisted anchor**: duplicate uploads (benign —
/// server-deduped via externalId UPSERT) plus redundant network and battery.
///
/// This actor serializes the sweep body per key:
///   - while a body runs, further `run` calls return immediately;
///   - but they set a `queued` flag, so the in-flight call re-runs the body
///     once more after it finishes (exactly one trailing re-run, no matter how
///     many triggers landed mid-flight).
///
/// The trailing re-run matters: a plain `inFlight`-bool would DROP a mid-sweep
/// observer fire, and the sample that caused it would wait for the next HK
/// wakeup / app launch. With the re-run, the second pass starts from the
/// anchor the first pass just advanced, picks up only the new samples, and a
/// quiet pass is a cheap empty anchored query.
///
/// **Semantics note:** only the FIRST caller's closure is (re-)executed; a
/// coalesced caller's closure is never invoked. The importers always pass the
/// same operation for a given key, so this is the intended behaviour.
///
/// **W1 (1.3.0, HealthLog#1173) — logging and a watchdog.** `inFlight` was
/// cleared only by the running call's `defer`. A body whose await never
/// returned (a HealthKit query callback that never fires is the suspect) kept
/// its key in flight for the rest of the process, and every later trigger was
/// folded into a run that would never finish, without a trace. Every run now
/// logs its start and end (`notice`, category `healthkit`, so it persists), a
/// trigger folded into a run older than a minute says how old, and a trigger
/// that finds a body running longer than `staleAfter` starts a new run. The
/// stale run is fenced by its id: it neither clears the new run's slot nor
/// starts another trailing re-run.
