/// server v1.42.4).
///
/// Every integration status read carries it: `GET /api/integrations/status`
/// per entry, the per-provider `GET /api/{withings,whoop,fitbit,google-health,
/// polar,oura,strava,nightscout}/status`, and the Apple Health read
/// `GET /api/integrations/healthkit`. It supersedes the legacy fields
/// (`state`, `lastError`, `consecutiveFailuresByKind`, `syncHealth`,
/// `tokenExpired`, `needsReauth`, `hasActivityScope`, `planUnavailable`,
/// `scopeReconnect`), which v1.43 marks deprecated and v1.44 removes.
///
/// **Render from `state` / `reason` / `action` only.** The app picks one
/// sentence per `reason` and offers at most one button for `action`; it never
/// derives its own state from the older fields.
///
/// **Tolerant on every field.** A word this build does not know becomes
/// ``State/unknown`` / ``Reason/unknown`` / no action, never a failed status
/// read. Callers decode the whole object with `try?` so a malformed `health`
/// reads as absent rather than breaking the integration card.
