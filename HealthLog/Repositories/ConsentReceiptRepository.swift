///
/// **Why this exists (RCA W-INSIGHTSDATA Bug 2).** Server v1.12.1 enforcement
/// (server commit `37e9f32f`, live since ~2026-06-05) requires an ACTIVE
/// `ConsentReceipt` (`ai_insights_only` or the master `ai_full`) before any
/// LLM egress on a server-managed provider chain — and the default chain ends
/// in the operator's global key (`admin-openai`), so practically every account
/// trips the gate. The receipt infrastructure was built for the iOS client to
/// mint ("the three consent surfaces the iOS client collects"), but no client
/// ever called `POST /api/consent/ai`. Result: `runStatusCompletion` fails
/// closed to the no-key fallback for the whole per-metric status family — the
/// Insights metric sub-pages lost their "Einschätzung" prose (the overview
/// Tagesbriefing survived only because it falls back to the deterministic
/// period narrative).
///
/// This repo is the thin wire wrapper. #143 (server v1.43.2): a receipt is
/// minted ONLY from the person's Accept tap (`AppContainer.recordAcceptedAIConsent`,
/// body `confirm: true`); launch, shell mount and the Coach read the standing
/// state from `ai.consent` on `GET /api/auth/me` and never mint. Revoked on the
/// explicit master-off.
