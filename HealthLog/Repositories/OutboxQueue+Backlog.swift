// W1 (1.3.0, #126 1.1/1.3, HealthLog#1173) — "N Einträge warten auf
// Verbindung" counts only rows the replay can still send.
//
// Up to 1.2.0 the banner and the slot glyph took `ops.count` of the live
// snapshot (`SyncStateStore.bindOutbox`). That snapshot also carries rows the
// replay never sends on its own: rows it parked (`parked:` marker, see
// `HealthKitReplayParked`), rows whose retry budget ran out (held until the
// seven-day dead-letter sweep), rows of another account and rows this build
// cannot attribute. The count therefore stood at "6" for days while every
// sync around it succeeded. The count now asks the same questions the replay
// asks before it sends, and the rows it leaves out are listed in Sync
// Diagnostics with their reason and "Erneut senden".
